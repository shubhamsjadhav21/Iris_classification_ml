# Iris_classification_ml
# Preview of Data
•	There are 150 observations with 4 features each (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).

•	There are no null values, so we don't have to worry about that.

•	There are 50 observations of each species (setosa, versicolor, virginica).
# Data Visualization
•	After graphing the features in a pair plot, it is clear that the relationship between pairs of features of a iris-setosa (in pink) is distinctly different from those of the other two species.

•	There is some overlap in the pairwise relationships of the other two species, iris-versicolor (brown) and iris-virginica (green).
